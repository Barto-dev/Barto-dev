## :heart: build software

Hi, my name is Illia. I am a full-stack developer. I enjoy solving complex engineering problems that need to be thought
through carefully. Constantly interested in everything related to the web platform and Progressive Web Applications.

<h3>Tools, languages, and other things that I like to work with.</h3>
