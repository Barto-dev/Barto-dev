## :heart: build software

Hi, my name is Illia. I am a front-end developer. I enjoy solving complex engineering problems that need to be thought through carefully. Constantly interested in everything related to the web platform and Progressive Web Applications. I believe that the difference between the web and the native platform will soon disappear, thanks to projects like [Fugu](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/), and the people who come up with all these cool features and implement them in browsers.
